# PhD Scripts

Scripts I am using in my PhD.

Documentation for the phdscripts python package is included
in the [doc](doc) folder - to view the latest version, clone this repo then run
the following:

```bash
cd <path/to/repo>/doc
make html
```

Sphinx will build the documentation under the `doc/_build` folder; point your
browser at `doc/_build/index.html` to view the pages locally.
